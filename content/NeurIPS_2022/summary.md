Scaling from a dozen cells a decade ago to millions of cells today, single-cell measurement technologies are driving a revolution in the life sciences. Recent advances make it possible to measure multiple high-dimensional modalities (e.g. DNA accessibility, RNA, and proteins) simultaneously in the same cell. Such data provides, for the first time, a direct and comprehensive view into the layers of gene regulation that drive biological diversity and disease.

In 2021, we organized the first single-cell analysis competition at NeurIPS bringing together 280 participants to compete on an atlas-scale dataset of human bone marrow cells from 12 donors generated across 4 sites globally. 

In this competition for [NeurIPS 2022](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/CompetitionTrack), we will build on this success, address concerns identified from a survey of the participants in our 2021 competition, and extend the tasks to include a further open problem in single-cell data science: modelling multimodal time series. We are generating a new dataset to complement our previous atlas, modifying our competition submission system, and refining the task metrics to better capture biological processes regulating the flow of genetic information.

We're hard at work finalizing the details of the competition. To be the first to hear about the competition, sign up for our [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe90Oky4-1b0HbdLsp5Yqo9juCd2mq-NlGHU9NHRW1ECok1xQ/viewform) for updates. 


For now, check out this video we produced for our 2021 competition below!
