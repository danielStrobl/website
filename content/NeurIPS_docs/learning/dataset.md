We are currently in the process of creating a benchmarking dataset for the competition. There will be two types of data:
* Joint profiling of single-cell RNA and protein using the [10X Genomics
Single Cell Gene Expression with Feature Barcoding](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/overview/doc/getting-started-single-cell-gene-expression-with-feature-barcoding-technology) with the  [Biolegend TotalSeqâ„¢-B Universal Cocktail v1.0](https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/products/totalseq-a-human-universal-cocktail-v1-0-20321?GroupID=GROUP28) panel  
* Joint profiling of single-nucleus RNA and chromatin accessibility using the [10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Kit](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression)  

We'll update this page with more information as we have updates, but for now, we are releasing several public datasets to use for training and exploration.
