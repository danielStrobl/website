The rapid advances in data-driven approaches to biology in recent
years have introduced new frontiers for research, exploration, and
understanding of biological processes at a resolution never before
seen. Single-cell omics technologies allow for profiling of cellular features
such as gene expression or protein abundance across tens of thousands of cells
in an experiment that can be readily performed in a standard laboratory. However,
analyzing these new data modalities require development of novel methods to
unlock novel biological insights.

Recent advances in representation learning (in particular, in
fields involving self supervised, multi-view, and transfer learning)
hold the key to alleviating such challenges to lift some of the main
barriers in the field and unlock new capabilities bridging data
science, machine learning, and computational biology. To this end, we
will hold a multi-modal single cell data analysis competition to
expose the machine learning community to predominant problems
encountered in biomedical multiomic applications, and the
computational biology community to a wider range of state of the art
machine learning methods, which may not be traditionally associated or
applied to biomedical data. We ask participants to learn meaningful
joint embeddings from multimodal data and to infer missing or
corrupted features.
